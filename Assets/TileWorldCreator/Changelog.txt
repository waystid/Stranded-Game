New: Added invert collision walls option to Tile Collider Mesh generation.
--
Bugfix: Fixed build error: An asset is marked with HideFlags.DontSave
Bugfix: Fixed issue with Tile Collision mesh generation. Each cluster object contained tile collision mesh from whole the map instead of the cluster only.


4.1.2

Bugfix: Fixed object layer not using default layer height offset.
Bugfix: Fixed object layer not using layerOffset X and Z offsets.
Bugfix: Fixed object layer not correctly parenting cluster object, resulting in wrong collision mesh position when using TileCollder mesh.

New: Added global mesh generation properties in configuration settings. Build layer mesh generation properties can be used to override global settings.
--
Bugfix: Fixed tile collision generation offset issue when using a cell size other than 1.
